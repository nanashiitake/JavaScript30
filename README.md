# JavaScript 30 projects

These are my solutions to [Java 30 Days](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

## My approach

I'll probably just see what the project is about and then try to do it on my own, if I encounter any difficulties I will just watch the given tutorial, solve my problems and keep going on my own.

The given files include an html file and an css file. I will do everything I can do on my own from scratch, and twist some things up to give it my own ✨SPICE✨
