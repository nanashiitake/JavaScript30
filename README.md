# JavaScript 30 projects

These are my solutions to [Java 30 Days](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

## My approach

I'll probably just see what the project is about and then try to do it on my own, if I encounter any difficulties I will just watch the given tutorial, but I'll try to keep that to the bare minimum.

The given files include an html file and an css file. I will do everything I can do scratch, and twist some things up to give it my own ✨SPICE✨

## Updates

As for today 14/01/2023
I will keep with this 30 Days challenge but I will simultaneously follow a UDEMY course that I've found very interesting. I think that this combo could get me very far in a 30 days span.
